                        AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
                        unlike the natural intelligence displayed by
                        humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.

                    <p>
                        Pop is a genre of popular music
                    that originated in its modern
                    form during the mid-1950s in
                    the United States and the United Kingdom.
                    The terms popular music and pop music
                    are often used interchangeably,
                    although the former describes
                    all music that is popular and
                    includes many disparate styles.

                        Arizona is a state in the Southwestern region
                    of the United States.
                    It is also usually considered part

                    Arizona is the 48th state and last
                    of the contiguous states to be admitted
                    to the Union,

                xkcd, sometimes styled XKCD, is a webcomic created in 2005 by American author Randall Munroe. The comic's tagline describes it as <q>A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language</q>. Munroe states on the comic's website that the name of the comic is not an initialism but <q>just a word with no phonetic pronunciation</q>.

                The subject matter of the comic varies from statements on life and love to mathematical, programming, and scientific in-jokes. Some strips feature simple humor or pop-culture references. It has a cast of stick figures, and the comic occasionally features landscapes, graphs, charts, and intricate mathematical patterns such as fractals. New cartoons are added three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

                Munroe has released four spinoff books from the comic. The first book, chronologically, published in 2010 and entitled xkcd: volume 0 was a series of select comics from his website. His 2014 book What If? is based on his blog of the same name that answers unusual science questions from readers in a light-hearted way that is scientifically grounded. The What If column on the site is updated with new articles from time to time. His 2015 book Thing Explainer explains scientific concepts using only the one thousand most commonly used words in English. A fourth book, How To, which is described as "a profoundly unhelpful self-help book," was released on September 3, 2019.
